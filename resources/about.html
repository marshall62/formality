            <h1>About 4mality</h1>
            <p><em>4MALITY</em> is a web-based  tutoring system, designed to teach mathematical problem solving and test-taking  to elementary school children.  Researchers  from the School of Education, Department of Computer Science, and Center for  Educational Software Development (CESD) at the University of Massachusetts  Amherst are designing the system for use in public schools throughout  Massachusetts.  Housed on the  University’s server, <em>4MALITY</em> is  available free of charge to schools and families.<br />
                <br />
                <em>4MALITY</em> is implemented with the Java  servlet architecture supported by a relational database instance. The user  interface utilizes html and other scripting languages. The system contains MCAS-like  test questions, annotated with hints and feedback designed to teach a wide  range of problem solving techniques to students of various levels of knowledge. <em>4MALITY’s</em> grade level content  includes third through fifth grade.<br />
                <br />
              The MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive  Assessment System) is a standardized test of math skills, presenting word problems  that students must solve—in most instances, using multiple mathematical steps  and number operations.  Required of all  third, fourth, and fifth graders in the state’s public schools, MCAS is part of  how Massachusetts complies with the U. S. Government’s No Child Left Behind  (NCLB) law.<br />
  <br />
              For  each problem in <em>4MALITY</em>, there are  strategies and suggestions  authored from a particular problem solving “point of view.”  Four “virtual coaches”—intended to capture  the “character” of each problem solving approach—represent these “points of  view.”  Each coach has an iconographic  representation that helps students identify its problem solving  approaches.  </p>

                <div align="left"><u>Estella Explainer</u> is a language coach who helps children understand the language and meaning       of questions.</div>

            <p>These coaches represent a distillation of our collective experience  about how elementary school students approach solving MCAS-style math word  problems.</p>
            <h1>The History of 4mality </h1>
            <p>4th Grade MCAS Active Learning Intelligent Tutoring System (4mality) is a team-driven project aimed to increase 4th grade comprehension of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS).</p>
            <p>At the University of Massachusetts (Amherst), School of Education faculty members: Sharon Edwards, Bob Maloy, Oscar Loureiro and Gordon Anderson are working to introduce a trial of 4mality into elementary schools by June of 2010. </p>
