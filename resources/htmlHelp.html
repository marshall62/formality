<H3>HTML Help</H3>
<pre>
Use this tag for <b>images:</b> 

&lt;IMG SRC="/4mality/media/images/<font color=red>14bandGraph.jpg</font>" BORDER=0&gt;

The red part is the file name:  <font color=red>14bandGraph.jpg</font> 
Notice that the question id, 14, is placed at the beginning of 
the filename. This makes the file name unique- a requirement.
(You can get the id from the question editor). 
Just copy the tag above and paste it into the question
stem in the editor. Then substitute only the name of your file. 
Send me the file, I'll put it in it's proper place and voila, 
it will be a masterpiece. Note: you can add HEIGHT and WIDTH
attributes to the image tag with pixel values to adjust the
size of the image, however, the best practice is to create
the image to be the size you expect it to be on the page.

<b>Popup windows</b> (like the one you are reading) are easy, but see me.
Use this "tag" to call a popup window:

&lt;a HREF="javascript: extraWindow('/4mality/media/html/<font color=red>23hint4d.html</font>')"&gt;<font color=red>Your text</font>&lt;/a&gt;

Just put in the correct html file name and 
the text you want to appear on the page.
Send me the text, images, etc. you want in the popup.
You can also use the template file: extraWinTemplate.txt

This tag creates a <b>line break:</b>  &lt;br&gt;
You can use several of them to get more vertical space: 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

These six characters make the browser add a <b>horizontal space:</b> 
&#38;nbsp;
You can use several of them to get more horizontal space: 
&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;

These are <b>font style</b> tags:  bold=&lt;b&gt;  italic=&lt;i&gt; 
Note: you must supply closing tags (using the slash /) so the 
browser knows when to stop applying the style. For example:   
...it was the <i>way</i> he <b>said</b> it...
looks like this in HTML:  
..it was the &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; he &lt;b&gt;said&lt;/b&gt; it...

The <b>underline tag</b> is: &lt;u&gt;undelined text&lt;/u&gt;
<u>undelined text</u>

<b>Bullet Lists:</b>
<ul>
<li>First item
<li>Second item
<li>Third item
</ul> 

in html:
&lt;ul&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;First item<br>
&lt;li&gt;Second item<br>
&lt;li&gt;Third item<br>
&lt;/ul&gt;

Here is a <b>simple table</b> if you feel adventurous:
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0><tr>
<td>Gordon</td><td>79,407</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hillcrest</td><td>58,868</td></tr></table>

Here is how to make it:
&lt;TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gordon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;79,407&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hillcrest&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;58,868&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
You can copy and paste this, substituting your data, making new cells 
and rows as required.

If you want to <font color=green>change</font><font color=red> font</font><font color=blue> colors</font> you can do this:
&lt;font color=green&gt;text&lt;/font&gt;, 
see me, or look at the source code for this page! 

By the way, <b>certain characters are a no-no:</b> such as &lt; and &gt;.
Use these nasty things instead:  &#38;lt;  &#38;gt;

<b>Math Notation</b>
This is often difficult in html, but we can try:

<b>Fractions:</b> you can use the &lt;pre&gt; tag<br>
<pre>
   Here is one way to do fractions, although it is
                          1
   not real easy to align - the text around the fraction.
                          3
   You have to use a line for each number, as in this example.
</pre>
Here it is in html:
&lt;pre&gt;<pre>
   Here is one way to do fractions, although it is
                          1

                          3

</pre>&lt;/pre&gt;<br>

A more involved example:<br>
<pre>
                     -b &#177; Sqrt(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)
                 x = -------------------
                             2a
</pre>

<H3>Hint Tags</H3>
Each hint has a specific tag that identifies the text that should be 
highlighted with the appropriate color when a specific hint is 
selected. The hint tags work just the HTML font style tags: there is 
a beginning tag and a closing tag. Whatever is between the tags will 
be highlighted. For example, the words "Gordon Stadium" and "79,407" 
in this marked up text:

{h3a}Gordon Stadium{/h3a} can seat {h3a}79,407{/h3a} people,

will appear highlighted when the hint at level 3 for coach a is 
selected.
Note: coaches are lettered a, b, c, d. 

An easy way to apply tags is to go to the hint edit page. You get 
there by clicking on the hint ID in the hint table on the question 
editor page. That hint's tag will appear on the form. Copy it, go 
back to the question edit page and paste the tag in the appropriate 
place(s).

You can put any number of hint tags around the text. The inactive 
tags will be ignored. For example, the text "79,407" in these lines:

{h3a}Gordon Stadium{/h3a} can 
seat {h3a}{h5c}{h1a}79,407{/h1a}{/h5c}{/h3a} people,

is marked up to be highlighted for three different hints. 
Note: the order of hint tags does not matter, but you <b>must</b> 
provide a closing tag for each opening tag- or bad things will happen!!!
Test your question's appearance by selecting the "View Question" link
on the question edit page.
