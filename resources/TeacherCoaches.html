My job is to explain the math questions clearly so you know 
what you are supposed to do to solve the problem.  Sometimes 
there are unfamiliar or confusing terms in the question.
I will help you understand what they mean.  I love to read, 
and learning how to read math questions is very valuable skill 
to have.  Have fun with these problems, and remember, math is 
a language too.

Answering math questions means you need a plan and my role is 
to help you figure out different strategies for solving problems.  
Sometimes you can get the correct answer by crossing out the wrong 
answers; other times you can round numbers up or down to make 
figuring a problem easier.  I know other good strategies as well. 
Do great with math, and remember: math is smart thinking.

I am here to make sure that you know how to do the math needed to 
answer these questions.  You often needto do addition and subtraction 
or multiplication and division.  Other questions ask you to use 
fractions, decimals, large numbers, and probability. When you need 
ideas for what to do, I am ready.  Enjoy math, and remember, numbers 
can be your friends.

<td><h3>Hello.  My name is Visual Vera.</h3></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><pre>
I find math is a lot clearer when I take the numbers and words and 
put them into pictures and drawings, or move objects around so I can 
see how to answer a question.  Maybe you are a visual learner too.  
When you find yourself unsure about a question, see if one of my 
clues will explain what to do.  Happy mathing, and remember, math 
is pictures and action.
